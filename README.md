# PostWeaningDiarrhea-DataAnalysis

This repository contains the code and findings of a biomedical statistics project focusing on post-weaning diarrhea in pig farming. The project aims to analyze the effects of different treatments on piglet growth during the post-weaning period.

## Abstract
Post-weaning diarrhea poses significant challenges in pig farming, with traditional antimicrobial strategies facing resistance issues. This project utilizes statistical analysis in R to explore the impact of treatments, including zinc oxide (ZnO), nutraceuticals, and vaccination, on average daily weight gain (ADWG) in piglets.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis:** Employed R for descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, visualization, outlier detection, hypothesis testing, and linear modeling.
- **Results:** Detailed findings on data distribution, outliers, normality, homoscedasticity, and hypothesis testing.
- **Graphical Analysis:** Visual representation of gender differences, treatment effects, and data distributions.
- **Linear Model:** Fitted a linear regression model to understand the relationship between sex and ADWG0021.
